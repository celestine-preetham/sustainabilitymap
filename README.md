https://sustainabilitymap.earth/ is a simple web-app takes as input any image exported from https://viewer.esa-worldcover.org/worldcover/ and computes a "Sustainability index" defined as "tree cover/(tree cover + built area)"  within regions of interest marked by dragging a bounding box on the image.

See attached video for a live demo.
